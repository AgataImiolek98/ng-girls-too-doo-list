'Too-doo list' started on ng Girls 2024 workshop and continued on by own. It is a very basic application with form and list, where user can add, delete, save and edit tasks. 
I used:
  - service to comunicate components by dependency injecton,
  - local storage to store saved tasks,
  - extarnal library to style some elements
  - I also remeber about accessibility during adding some inputs, image and styles
